    </section>
    <section class="content1">
      <p class="p1">The event will be centred around the theme: An Era of Coexistence The era which we live in today has witnessed a rise in dependence on one another as living beings. Be it people helping each other in peak of COVID wave, or medical health professionals doing the same. To interact with a commitment to tolerance, mutual respect, and the agreement to settle conflicts without violence on the basis of differences, which our country has a lot of. Coexistence includes efforts that aim to address past wrongs, search for justice and forgiveness, build/rebuild communities and looking to strive towards the ultimate peace driven world that everyone wants to be a part of.</p>
      <p class="p1">In today’s COVID inflicted world, more often than not, we surrender to the circumstances and stop ourselves from even trying. It’s time to connect, to connect ideas, to connect humanity and hence look for a way to coexist because as Bertrand Russell rightly said, it's coexistence or no existence.</p>
      <p class="p1">With this event, we hope to increase an individual’s efforts to catalyse the coexistence process and more specifically the possibilities and opportunities that will assist us in achieving global harmony. TEDxKIET hopes to devise the opportunities that will encourage us to connect and proceed, with speakers from diverse fields and professions, who will motivate, educate and inform audiences about the nuances of life</p>
      <p class="p1">We wish to acknowledge the dependency and coexistence that not only fulfils the purpose, but also provides us with an immutable balance, which today’s world is in dire need of. History stands witness to how massive civilizations have declined and died when they become exclusivists. We are mere human beings.</p>
      <p class="p1">Keeping in mind the culture, and heritage of TED and our institute; the theme, An Era of Coexistence, promises an introspective journey that will not only help the speakers but will definitely help the audience find and nurture their own talent, potential and realize what and how they can contribute to bringing everyone closer to the other and hence, coexist in a more peaceful way.</p>
      <p class="p1">The event would act as a catalyst to educate as well as entertain the attendees by covering a broad domain of ideas that are worth spreading, sharing, imbibing and living by.</p>
