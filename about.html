        <h2>About TED</h2>
        <p class="p-ab">TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from
            science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.</p>

        <h2>About TEDx</h2>
        <p class="p-ab">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection.
            TEDx is an international community that organizes TED-style events anywhere and everywhere, commemorating locally-driven ideas and elevating them to a global stage. TEDx events are produced independently of TED conferences, each event curates
            speakers on their own, but according to TED’s format and rules.</p>
